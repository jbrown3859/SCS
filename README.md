# Objective:
We partnered with local surfboard craftsman, Sam Geller of SoCalShredz, to create the frontend for his growing business. 

# Project Description:
Built in Bootstrap Studio 4.3, socalshredz.com uses mostly HTML, CSS, and some JS with Bootstrap 4.3.

# Timescale: 
The start date of the project was September 14, 2018, and is ending this June with Lead Developer, Joey Brown, learning from Sam how to make a board by hand from start to finish.

# Process
This site was irst prototyped with all hand written HTML and CSS. Using Botostrap Studio, we were able to refine elements and make the site more fluid.
